Q: console.log(y);y or console.log(y);y=10
Ans:error becoz interpretor won't be able to rercognize whether it is variable or not because at the time of log y is not declared.
to meke it working
either use var y
if we use var than hoisting work
otherwise hoisting doesn't work in any way like y=10 or y;
*/

/*
//problem
tu(1);//error tu is not a function becoz tu is declared as variable during hoisting
//thatswhy compiler predict it as varaable and we are using it as function which shows
  error it is not function.
fg(1);//error :fg is not defined becoz fg is not declared nor defined
funn(1);//output => 1 becoz funn() is declaRED function declaration during hoisting tahtswhy
//compilaer predict it as function
function funn(i)
{
  console.log(i);
}

var tu=function (i)
{
  console.log(i);
}

var tu=function fg(i)
{
  console.log(i);
}

function student()
{
  var roll=1;
  return {getname:roll};
}
var obj= new student();
console.log(obj.getname); this will work but obj will treat like a object of student
var vik= student();
console.log(vik.getname); this will also work but vik will treat as a returned object returned by student function.
